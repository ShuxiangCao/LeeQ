## Parallel Work Opportunities

### Maximum Parallelization (4 developers)
1. **Developer 1**: Track A (MCP Server) → Track E (Python Client)
2. **Developer 2**: Track B (LeeQ Adapter) → Track D (Reset Commands)
3. **Developer 3**: Track C (Testing) → Track F (Results)
4. **Developer 4**: Documentation, Integration, Testing support

### Moderate Parallelization (2 developers)
1. **Developer 1**: Phase 1 → Track A → Phase 3 → Track E
2. **Developer 2**: Phase 1 → Track B + C → Phase 3 → Track D + F

### Solo Development (Optimized Order)
1. Phase 1: Foundation (must complete first)
2. Track B: LeeQ Adapter (with mocks)
3. Track A: MCP Server (can test with adapter)
4. Phase 3: Integration (connects everything)
5. Track E: Python Client (most valuable feature)
6. Track D + F: Additional features (as needed)

## Testing Strategy by Phase

### Phase 1 Tests
- Unit tests for all base classes
- Serialization round-trip tests
- Interface contract tests

### Phase 2 Tests  
- Component isolation tests
- Mock-based integration tests
- Protocol compliance tests

### Phase 3 Tests
- Integration tests with mocked LeeQ
- Data flow validation
- Performance benchmarks

### Phase 4 Tests
- Feature-specific test suites
- Client-server integration
- Error scenario coverage

### Phase 5 Tests
- End-to-end workflows
- Load testing
- Stability testing

## Implementation Tips

### For Efficient Development
1. **Use Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first for clear interfaces
2. **Mock Early**: Don't wait for LeeQ integration to test
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Get basic functionality working, then enhance
4. **Document as You Go**: Easier than retrofitting

### For Parallel Work
1. **Define Interfaces First**: Clear contracts prevent integration issues
2. **Use Feature Branches**: Merge frequently to avoid conflicts
3. **Communicate Changes**: Especially interface modifications
4. **Test Continuously**: Catch integration issues early

### Critical Path
The shortest path to a working system:
1. Phase 1 (Foundation)
2. Track B (LeeQ Adapter with mocks)
3. Track A (MCP Server basics)
4. Phase 3.1 (Connect LeeQ to MCP)
5. Track E (Python Client minimal)

This gets you a functional system that can run LeeQ experiments remotely.

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
- **Phase 1**: All data types serialize correctly
- **Phase 2**: Components work in isolation
- **Phase 3**: Can run a LeeQ experiment via MCP
- **Phase 4**: All features accessible via client
- **Phase 5**: Production-ready quality

### Overall Success
- Complete test coverage (>85%)
- All LeeQ experiments discoverable
- Real-time data streaming functional
- Python client can control full experiment lifecycle
- System stable under continuous use

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **MCP Library Availability**: Build abstraction layer
2. **LeeQ Integration Complexity**: Use extensive mocking
3. **Performance Issues**: Profile early and often

### Process Risks
1. **Integration Conflicts**: Frequent merging
2. **Scope Creep**: Stick to plan, defer enhancements
3. **Testing Gaps**: Continuous coverage monitoring

This plan optimizes for:
- Clear dependencies and parallel opportunities
- Early testability through mocking
- Incremental value delivery
- Flexible team scaling
- Reduced integration risk
