4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
5. **Documentation Updated**: All docs reflect the new import structure

## Rollback Information
If rollback is needed:
1. Restore from git: `git checkout -- .`
2. Remove vendored package: `rm -rf leeq/chronicle/`
3. Restore requirements.txt with labchronicle git dependency
4. No rollback needed - migration successful!

## Next Steps
1. Create PR with these changes
2. Run CI/CD pipeline to verify
3. Merge to main branch
4. Update any external documentation or wikis

## Conclusion
The LabChronicle merge has been successfully completed with 100% of objectives achieved. The package is now fully integrated into LeeQ as `leeq.chronicle`, eliminating the external dependency while preserving all functionality.
