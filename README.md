LeeQ is a Python package for orchestrating quantum computing experiments with easy-to-use syntax, with a specific focus
on superconducting circuits-based quantum computing systems.

## Quick Start 

See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick_start.md) for a 10-minute guide to launch LeeQ. Or the [One-hour full tutorial tutorial](docs/tutorial.md).

A notebook example and configuration example are prepared in the [notebook](notebooks) folder.
